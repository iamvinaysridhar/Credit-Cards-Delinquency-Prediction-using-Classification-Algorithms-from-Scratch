# Credit-Cards-Delinquency-Prediction-using-Classification-Algorithms-from-Scratch

• Processed a credit card delinquency dataset with 30,000+ rows and 20 attributes using Python, employing data pre-processing, cleaning,
transformation, and exploratory data analysis, and mitigated class imbalance through resampling techniques like SMOTE.
• Developed machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Hard-margin SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multi-Layer Perceptron
Classifier from scratch without using libraries, achieving a robust 77% performance with the MLP Classifier across diverse evaluation metrics.
• Rigorously validated the artificial neural network model on a test dataset to gauge its generalization capabilities to new, unseen data.
